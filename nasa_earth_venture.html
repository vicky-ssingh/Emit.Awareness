          <h2>A NASA Earth Venture Instrument & Installed on the International Space Station</h2>
          <p>
          <ol>
            In NASA's Earth Venture Mission-2 competition, proposals for payloads on the exterior of the International
            Space Station (ISS) for Earth observation are not accepted. Instead, the focus is on standalone spacecraft
            missions managed by single principal investigators. The mission cost is capped at $166 million (2018
            dollars), with a launch deadline of June 30, 2022</ol>

          <ol>No Exterior ISS Payloads: The competition excludes proposals for exterior ISS payloads for Earth
            observation.</ol>
          <ol>Mission Parameters: Mission cost is limited to $166 million, and the launch deadline is set for June 30,
            2022</ol>
          <ol>Proposal Timeline: NASA required proposers to notify their intentions by October 2, with final proposals
            due
            by December 4. The award for one proposal is expected in August 2016</ol>
          <ol>Cubesat Proposals: While exterior ISS payloads are not allowed, Cubesat proposals are permitted. Launching
            them
            from the ISS's Cubesat dispenser is not prohibited.</ol>
          <ol>Earth Venture Missions: These missions aim to enhance our understanding of global changes from the
            atmosphere
            downward, with a broader scope than just observing Earth itself.</ol>
          <ol>Previous Success: The first Earth Venture mission solicitation was in 2011 and resulted in the Cyclone
            Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) winning in 2012.</ol>
          <ol>ISS Earth Science Payloads: NASA had previously encouraged the use of instruments on the ISS for Earth
            science observations.</ol>
          <ol>Grounded Vehicles: SpaceX's Dragon and Orbital ATK's Cygnus, used for ISS payloads, faced temporary
            grounding due
            to launch failures but were scheduled to resume flights.</ol>
          <ol>Langley's Lunar Observation Proposal: A proposal to observe the moon using a compact spectrometer on a
            small
            satellite was considered but not submitted in the latest Earth Science competition.</ol>
          <ol>Earth System Science Pathfinder: Earth Venture missions are part of the Earth System Science Pathfinder
            program,
            which includes suborbital missions and instrument proposals.</ol>
          <ol>Instrument Solicitations: Principal investigators can propose hosting their payloads on nondedicated
            spacecraft.
            An award for the Earth Venture Instrument payload is expected by March</ol>
          <ol>Budget Constraints: Earth Venture missions have limited budgets and are among NASA's smallest principal
            investigator-led missions under the Science Mission Directorate.</ol>

          <h2>Methane â€˜Super-Emitters' Mapped by NASA's New Earth Space Mission</h2>
          <p>
            <ol>
              The NASA Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) mission, located on the International Space
            Station (ISS), is primarily focused on mapping key minerals in Earth's dust-producing deserts to advance our
            understanding of the impact of airborne dust on climate. However, EMIT has also demonstrated the ability to
            detect methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The mission has identified over 50 "super-emitters" of methane in
            regions including Central Asia, the Middle East, and the Southwestern United States. Super-emitters are
            facilities or infrastructure that release methane at high rates, often associated with fossil fuels, waste,
            or agriculture.

             </ol>
            <ol>Methane is a critical greenhouse gas, significantly more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide in
              the short term. Identifying methane point sources, such as those detected by EMIT, is crucial for addressing
              emissions and mitigating their impact on climate change.</ol>
            <ol>Methane is a critical greenhouse gas, significantly more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide in
              the short term. Identifying methane point sources, such as those detected by EMIT, is crucial for addressing
              emissions and mitigating their impact on climate change.</ol>
            <ol>EMIT's unique capabilities come from its imaging spectrometer, which can discern the spectral fingerprint of
              methane and measure carbon dioxide accurately. The mission's broad coverage of Earth's surface and
              high-resolution imaging enable it to identify methane sources down to the facility scale.</ol>
            <ol>EMIT's methane observations have exceeded expectations, detecting large plumes from various sources,
              including oil and gas infrastructure, waste-processing complexes, and landfills. These findings highlight
              the potential for hundreds of super-emitters to be discovered as EMIT continues its survey of the planet.</ol>
            <ol>Additionally, EMIT's mineral data will contribute to climate modeling by helping researchers understand the
              role of airborne dust particles in Earth's climate processes. This dual capability of EMIT enhances our
              ability to monitor and address greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on global warming.</ol>
            
            <ol>

              The International Space Station hosts seven instruments for NASA Earth Science, including EMIT, which
              provides valuable information for studying and understanding the changing planet. EMIT is the first of its
              kind, and its data will be shared with researchers and the public through the NASA Land Processes
              Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC). This mission demonstrates how space-based technology can play a
              crucial role in monitoring and mitigating climate change.
